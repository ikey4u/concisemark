in mind. The `simplified` here means it only supports some common markdown syntax but not full.

## Features

- Latex PDF Generation

    ConciseMark supports you to convert your markdown into xelatex source file, then you can compile it
    with xelatex command to generate a pretty PDF document.

    Note that to make the generated xelatex source compilable, you have to install the following
    fonts onto your system

    - [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora)
    - [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?category=Monospace)
    - [Source Han Serif SC](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/releases)

- markdown meta

    You can put an optional html comment (whose body is in toml format) in the front of your markdown file

        <!---
        title = "Your title"
        subtitle = "Your subtitle"
        date = "2021-10-13 00:00:00"
        authors = ["name <example@gmail.com>"]
        tags = ["demo", "example"]
        -->

    This content will be parsed as your page meta, you can use it when rendering latex or html page.
